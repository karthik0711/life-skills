### 1. What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.
- Feynman Technique is a learning techinque which tell us how to learn faster by explaining to others in simple words.

### 2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

**Active Mode or Focused Mode:**
- Focused mode is when we work hard and think about something we alredy know well. it is like we are working on something which we know that previously.

- study in intervals, which means we can use ***Pomodoro technique*** this technique tells that study 25 mins focused and take 5-min break to maintain concentration.
- we can maintain short notes for everythink which we learnt and write summaries of what we learned.
- using our knowledge in real-world scenarios or projects. this will reinforces learning through practical application.
